# Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Marketing-using-K-Means-Clustering
1. Executive Summary & Business Objective
This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to customer segmentation, a critical strategy for effective marketing and business growth. By analyzing a dataset of credit card customers, this project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct segments based on their spending habits and account behavior.

The primary business objective is to move beyond a one-size-fits-all marketing strategy. By understanding the unique characteristics of each customer segment, a financial institution can:

Personalize Marketing Campaigns: Create targeted offers, promotions, and communications that resonate with specific groups.

Optimize Product Offerings: Develop new products or features tailored to the needs of each segment.

Improve Customer Retention: Identify at-risk customers or high-value customers and implement strategies to retain them.

Enhance Profitability: Increase revenue by focusing marketing spend on the most profitable segments and up-selling relevant services.

2. Key Skills Demonstrated
Programming & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning, K-Means Clustering, Model Evaluation (Elbow Method)

Data Science Workflow: Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data visualization.

Data Visualization: Creating insightful and clear plots to communicate results.

Business Acumen: Translating data-driven insights into actionable business recommendations.

3. Project Workflow & Methodology
The project followed a structured data science workflow:

Data Sourcing & Cleaning: The dataset was loaded and inspected for inconsistencies. Missing values in MINIMUM_PAYMENTS and CREDIT_LIMIT were handled by imputing them with the column mean to ensure the dataset was complete for analysis.

Feature Scaling: All features were standardized using StandardScaler. This is a crucial step for distance-based algorithms like K-Means, ensuring that features with larger scales (like BALANCE) do not disproportionately influence the outcome.

Dimensionality Reduction: To visualize the high-dimensional (17 features) dataset, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce it to two principal components, which capture the maximum variance in the data.

Optimal Cluster Selection: The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). By plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for K=1 through 10, the "elbow" at K=4 was identified as the point of diminishing returns, indicating four distinct customer segments.

Model Training: A K-Means model was trained on the scaled data with K=4 clusters.

Visualization: The resulting clusters were plotted on a 2D scatter plot using the two principal components, with each cluster color-coded for clear differentiation.

4. Analysis of Customer Segments & Actionable Recommendations
Based on the four identified clusters, we can define the following customer personas and recommend targeted strategies for each.

(To generate this analysis, you would add code to your script to inspect the characteristics of each cluster, like this: data['cluster'] = y_kmeans_pca; print(data.groupby('cluster').mean()))

Segment 0: The Prudent Spenders
Characteristics: Low balance, low purchase frequency, but high percentage of full payments. They use their card sparingly and pay off their balance diligently.

Business Recommendation: Engage them with loyalty programs that reward consistent, smaller purchases. Offer them educational content on maximizing credit card benefits and building a credit score. Avoid aggressive marketing for high-interest products.

Segment 1: The High-Value Transactors
Characteristics: High balance, very high purchase amounts (both one-off and installment), and high credit limits. These are the most active and valuable customers.

Business Recommendation: Treat them as VIPs. Offer exclusive premium rewards, concierge services, and higher credit limits. Market high-end affiliate products and travel packages. A dedicated relationship manager could be assigned to this segment.

Segment 2: The Revolvers / At-Risk
Characteristics: Very high balance, high cash advance frequency, but low purchase frequency and low percentage of full payments. This group carries a significant amount of debt and may be facing financial strain.

Business Recommendation: This segment requires a careful approach. Offer debt consolidation plans, lower interest rate promotions, and financial wellness tools. Proactive outreach can prevent defaults and build long-term trust.

Segment 3: The Everyday Users
Characteristics: Moderate balance, high purchase frequency (especially installments), and average credit limits. They use their card regularly for day-to-day expenses.

Business Recommendation: Focus on cashback offers for common spending categories like groceries, fuel, and online shopping. Introduce "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) features and market partner offers that align with their everyday spending habits.

5. Future Improvements
Experiment with Other Algorithms: Compare the results of K-Means with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.

Feature Engineering: Create new features (e.g., spending ratios, payment-to-balance ratio) to potentially uncover more nuanced segments.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a simple web application where new customer data can be entered to assign them to a segment in real-time.
